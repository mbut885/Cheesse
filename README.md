# Cheesse

Cheesse is a simple yet fully functional chess game built for the **SOFTENG 310** project based graphicaly on CHEESE!!!
It follows the official rules of chess and allows:  
- **Single-player mode** against bots of varying difficulty *(planned)*  
- A **web-hosted user interface** with interactive visuals  

---

## What does this project do?  
Cheesse provides a fully interactive chess experience with a graphical web interface based on cheese. Players can enjoy classic chess matches either locally against friends or against computer-controlled opponents (Plan for the future). The game enforces all the rules of chess, including special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

## Why is this project useful?  
- A fun and educational way to learn and practice chess.  
- Helps beginners understand legal moves and chess strategies.  
- Provides a structured codebase for learning about **game logic, AI, and front-end web development**.
